                <h2>What is HIOT?</h2>
                <p>
                    HIOT - pronounced Hi Oh Tee is the Hierarchical Internet Of Things and is an end-to-end IOT ecosystem, designed to maximise scalability and interoperability. It is not just a platform, but is built on a Roles based architecture, allowing you to distribute
                    functionality and remove bottlenecks across a deployment. Roles such as Aggregators and Bridges are what differentiate HIOT as these allow for integration with any number of 3rd party solutions and devices while also enabling traditional
                    platform-based data processing tasks to be executed on any device.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any device capable of running NodeJS can be used as any part of an HIOT deployment
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-grey">
                <h2>Where can I see it in action?</h2>
                <p>We'll have a demo version online in Q2 2018, but anyone with experience of npm and MongoDB can download our repos from GitHub and try it for themselves. </p>

                    How does it work?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    By spreading data processing and aggregation across the whole IOT deployment, devices can effectively "look after themselves". Traditional, cloud-based solutions gather raw data from across the IOT deployment and then process this centrally. Newer, Fog
                    computing platforms are attempting to do some data processing and aggregation at the edge of the deployment (before uploading to the cloud). HIOT is a multiple hierarchical solution - allowing devices to manage granular aggregation
                    - in other words, all devices across a deployment are involved in data aggregation, processing and analysis data relevant to them. For example, an Aggregator might be responsible for calculating the average temperature for a particular
                    floor in a building - this data is sourced from multiple sensors as well as other Aggregators (e.g. for a large open-plan office on the same floor) and can be sent to other Aggregators (e.g. the temperature across the whole building).

                    HIOT can be used across any IOT use case. In order to get the maxmimum benefit from it, it is useful to consider how you want your data to be aggregated. Feel free to get in touch with us if there are particular areas you would like to discuss.

                <h2>Why did you build another IOT platform?</h2>
                <p> We wanted something simple, but extensible - and we wanted it to be Open-Source and ready out-of-the-box. When we couldn't find something that "ticked all the boxes" we built our own. </p>

                <h4>SIMPLIFIED CONFIGURATION</h4>
                <p>HIOT uses JSON based control manifests to describe the functionality and configuration of each device. Once a device is added to a deployment it can be reconfigured from the platform at any time and from anywhere.<br/> We also have an
                    Auto-discovery function built into each device so you can find and configure new devices at the click of a button<br/> The JSON manifests &amp; Auto-discovery functionality can be used to integrate new devices directly into your HIOT
                    deployment, offering true plug-and-play capabilities.

                <p> HIOT implements multiple levels of distributed aggregation and control, allowing you to grow truly massive deployments.<br/> Larger IOT deployments can "stack" Aggregators and brokers to minimise the number of messages and aggregation

                <p>As a "know-nothing" architecture, any compatible device or solution can be effortlessly integrated into HIOT, resulting in greatly reduced complexity and simplified integration and interoperability. Simply add a new device to your local
                    network and run auto-discovery from any coordinator. The device can then be configured as part of your IOT deployment from any client app.

                <h4>ROLE BASED ARCHITECTURE</h4>
                <p>A set of distinct roles (e.g. Aggregators and Brokers) can be distributed across all devices. By providing you with real-time data on the performance of each device in your deployment, HIOT can help you ensure that not only does everything
                    work, but that it works as efficiently as possible. We cover this in A LOT more detail in the Architecture section.

                <p><strong>Sensors And Controllers</strong></p>
                <p>It might seem obvious, but it's important to differentiate between the real-world sensor and the IOT "Thing" that receives data from it. Similarly, a controller (e.g. for your office HVAC system isn't part of the Thing that integrates
                    with it.</p>
                <p>In HIOT, the sensor and controller are part of the real-world environment, we use them to learn about and alter our environment and as long as we can get real-world data and make real-world changes we don't really care that much about
                    them. This will make more sense later...</p>

                <p>The Platform has everything you would expect; Dashboards, device configuration and monitoring tools, Controller interfaces, Analytics and Business Intelligence etc. In time, we're going to set up a demo platform to showcase some of the
                    features you can expect from HIOT.

                <p>We have a number of implementations for you to choose from depending on your particular needs - from small Vagrant boxes and simple NodeJS implementations, to production-ready OpenStack deployment scripts and a whole lot in between</p>
                <p>As with all the other components in HIOT, the key aspect of the Platform is the API (or in this case, APIs) - these are fully documented and available in our Wiki.</p>

                <p><strong>Things</strong></p>
                <p>In HIOT, the Thing is the edge of the deployment. A Thing can connect to any number of Sensors and is only limited by its physical interfaces (e.g. GPIO pins.)</p>
                <p>We like to keep our Things as simple as possible. While a lot of IOT SDK etc. focus on devices like Intel&reg; NUC and Raspberry Pi&reg; devices capable of running a 'full' operating system, we like to use much simpler devices for 2 reasons,
                    1) they're a fraction of the cost (useful if you're deploying thousands of Things) and, 2) they have a much smaller attack surface as they typically need to be physically connected to a boot-loader in order to update their code. </p>
                <p>We're developed a full &amp; free (in every sense of the word) API implementation for devices like the Arduino Uno and the WiFi enabled ESP8266-based Wemos D1 and D1 mini. We also have NodeJS and Java implementations for more demanding
                    Things.

                <p><strong>Aggregators</strong></p>
                <p>Aggregators are one of the truly unique concepts within HIOT. </p>
                <p>Aggregators can be deployed anywhere in your HIOT ecosystem and are used to collate and aggregate data from things and pass them upstream towards the platform. Aggregators can be chained, or stacked, so that you can distribute the data
                    processing workload across the ecosystem as your HIOT deployment grows.</p>
                <p>There are some examples in the architecture section of the site that will provide more details on distributed aggregation.

                <p><strong>Brokers</strong></p>
                <p>Whereas Aggregators collect and aggregate data from Things and pass them up to the Platform, Brokers are responsible for receiving commands from the Platform and passing them on to the relevant Things, Aggregators or other Brokers. Like
                    Aggregators, Brokers can be chained together enabling massive scalability by decomposing the HIOT deployment into smaller functional units</p>

                <p><strong>Coordinator</strong></p>
                <p>Typically, there will be one Coordinator per physical location (apart from any redundant devices that might be used in the event of a failure). A coordinator manages every HIOT device in the location and is the only device in the location
                    with access to the outside world. There is no hard limit to the number of devices which can be managed by a single coordinator. The Architecture section has some details on the factors which could impact (positively or negatively)
                    the performance of the Coordinator.

                <p>
                    We've deliberately split the HIOT UI from the main cloud platform in order to allow users to develop their own front-ends or client apps. As well as that, the "Commander" and "Dashboard" repos on GitHub demonstrate how you can connect and engage with
                    local devices in your deployment (rather than having to query the main platform)
